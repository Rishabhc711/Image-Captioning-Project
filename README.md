# Image Captioning Project
 ###This project involved the use of a modified pre-trained ResNet50 model to map english words to the input imageâ€™s features to produce a caption through text generators (of GloVe word embedding).                          It involved concepts of Image Processing, Word Embeddings, GAN modelling. It had a BLEU score as its evaluation metric.
